# Privacy Policy
This privacy policy governs your use of the GitHub app Check TODO (hereby, "app") 
that was created by Jude Pereira. Check TODO allows you to discover 
added/edited TODO items in your code, when a Pull Request is created/updated.

# What information does the app obtain and how is it used?
When a GitHub Pull Request is created or commits are added to it (in the branch),
a webhook delivers information such as diff result. The app checks for any lines
which contain the characters "TODO" and reports them by creating a GitHub check.

No data is persisted.

# Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the app?
Absolutely not.

# Data Retention Policy
No data is retained. The app is 100% stateless, and does not persist ANY data.

# Security
We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. 
We limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors 
who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our app. 
Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information 
we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.

# Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. 
We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. 
You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, 
as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

# Contact us
If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the app, 
or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at contact [at] judepereira [dot] com.
