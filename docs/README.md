# Check TODOs
A GitHub app which automatically adds a check which searches for new or modified TODOs in your Pull Requests once installed.

## Installation
Head over to the app in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/apps/check-todos) to install this app.

## Why?
I often tend to push commits which are in a WIP state, and have todos all over them. These obviously go to a feature branch. However, when a PR is created, I'd like to ensure that all the todos added were implemented :)

## Inspiration
This app has been inspired by IntelliJ IDEA's *Check TODO* feature.
